Probably an embarrassing amount. Here are 6 drills you can do to improve your short game and start eliminating those horrible 3 putts.\n<p>During this time of COVID not all of us are allowed to go on the golf course, so the first 3 drills you can do at home to improve your game.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic\">\n<h3> Drill #1: Meter Stick</h3>\n<div class=\"PD-meterstick pic right\"></div>\nThe meter stick drill is one that seems deceivingly easy, but is much harder than you would think...\n<p>Here is how it goes: find a flat spot in your house somewhere, and place a meter stick on the ground. Grab your putter and ball, and attempt to putt from one side of the meter stick to the other without the ball falling off. You will soon find that this is much harder to do than you would think</p>\n<p>This is a drill that you can do both at home and on the course. You can do this on the course by simply putting the hole at the end of the meter stick.</p>\n<p>The meter stick drill helps with your alignment, by forcing you to keep your ball on the stick.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic\">\n<h3>Drill #2: Manilla Folder Trick</h3>\n<div class=\"PD-manilla\"></div>\nThe meter stick drill is one that seems deceivingly easy, but is much harder than you would think...\n<p>Here is how it goes: find a flat spot in your house somewhere, and place a meter stick on the ground.

Basically you set a goal for how many you want to make in a row, but you set up anywhere from 3 - 10 balls around the whole in a circle, all being about 3 feet. Once you reach the goal, move all the balls out a foot or a few. Then repeat! It is very frustrating and can really building your putting skills under pressure\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic\">\n<h3>Drill #5: Pull Back</h3>\n<div class=\"PD-pull-back\"></div>\nThis drill made me feel like I was actually putting on the course, because this is how it usually feels. \n<p>How it goes: Putt 9 holes and keep score (1 is birdie, 2 is par, 3 is bogey), but the tricky part is, after your first putt, you have to pull the ball back one club length. This is very helpful in making those 6 foot puts when you really need then, and simulating a lot of pressure</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic\">\n<h3>Drill #6: 100 3 foot putts</h3>\n<div class=\"PD-100-putts\"></div>\nThe drill is quite self explanatory. Set up a 3 foot put and do it 100 times...\n<p>This seems like it would be easy peasy, but once you get started and once you get to around the 90s the pressure starts to build, and those tap ins start to feel like 30 foot putts as you realize that if you miss them, you go all the way back to zero. </p>\n<p>This putting drill builds tons of pressure extremely fast!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"center\">Have fun! Let me know how this affects your putting strokes.</h3>"}
