Are you better than\n    the average golfer? The answer is of course, and with this guide we can prove that with the scores.\n<pre><code>Here are 10 tips for you to break 100:\n&#x3C;h3>Strategize your golf shots&#x3C;/h3>\nIf you are able to strategize what club you hit where to minimize the possibility of you hitting a bad shot, you\nwill easily be able to drop 5 shots or more.\n\nPar 3: Try to hit the green or try to a least get the ball close to the greens\n\nLong Par 4: Just be there in 3, don’t try to hit the green in two. Play it like a par 5.\n\nShort Par 4: Try to hit a good enough shot off the tee that you can hit the green in the next show with a mid or low\niron (6 or below). If you can’t reach with a mid or low iron, hit two wedge shots.\n\nPar 5: Play it like the Long Par 4. This is an easy hole to par or bogey.\nKnow your distances\nAn important thing to know when trying to break 100 is to know how far you hit each of you clubs.\n\nIf you can know how far you hit each of your clubs with a good shot, you can start to strategize your shots, and\nknow when to hit each club to hit greens...which brings us to the next idea\nAim for greens, not pins\nIt is important when you are begging to break 100, that you try not to aim for the pins, as they are usually in a\ntricky place what is very hard to hit, or a mis hit will penalize your score on that hole greatly.\n\nSo, plan on aiming for the green, specifically the biggest part of the green. Try not to go pin hunting!\nDo your best to aim away from hazards and bunkers\nBoth hazards and bunkers add many shots to your score.\n\nWhen playing a hole with a bunker or hazard, it is important to look for ways to take those obstacles out of play!\nThink about your last round and how many shots were lost because either you were stuck in a bunker or your ball was\nlost in hazard. If you can play a bit smarter, those shots can be taken off your score card\nYou don’t need to hit driver off the tee\nIf you are like many people trying to break 100, your driver might not be the most straight club in your bag...one\nway to take out the possibility of not hitting the fairway off the tee is to transition to a more strait club in\nyour bag.\n\nMany people only hit hybrids, or woods off the tee. I even know someone who can shot in the low 80’s and he only\nhits a 4 iron off the tee. The important part is to keep your ball in the fairway so your next shot can have a shot\nat the hole or an easier layup.\n\nThis is to say though, if you can hit a strong driver that stays straight, it is ok to keep playing it, this advice\nis only to those who struggle with the driver.\nOnly count your scores at the end of the 18 holes\nDon’t even count up your scores at 9 holes, all of this will hurt you when playing the last few holes, especially if\nyou are playing well and are on track! So just don’t pay attention to that, and pay attention to your next shot and\nhaving fun!!\nBad Shots are OK!\nYou should expect when going out to play golf that bad shots are going to happen. Even the pros hit bad shots.\nExpect them!! When you hit a bad shot, try not to let it phase you. Understand that bad shots are going to happen so\nwhy not let them happen now!!\n\nEven Bad Holes are expected. You are not going to par, or even bogey every hole. If you were going to do that, you\nwouldn’t be reading this guide to how to break 100. So when the bad holes come, just leave them behind you and go on\nto the next hole with a fresh mindset!\nWork on your 2 Putting abilities\nBeing able to 2 Putt constantly, even from afar is going to be extremely beneficial.\n\nThis is such a beneficial part of the game, that learning to 2 put constantly, with benefit you not only when trying\nto break 100, but also when trying to break 90 and even 80.\n\nAs helpful as it will be to never 2 putt, you are going to 3 putt so expect it and move on when it happens.\nLeave your ego in the locker room\nYou're not the best player in the world, so don’t let your ego make you play like you are. Leave your ego in the\nlocker room, and finally...\nHave Fun\nYou are out there to have fun, so don’t spend the whole time worrying about your score, and don’t take the game too\nseriously. Just go out there, relax and have fun!!\n</code></pre>\n</div>"}
