I think that is something we would all want! \n<p>Here are 2 workouts you can do to improve your golf game:</p>\n<div> \n<h3> Workout #1 </h3>\n<div class=\"WFG-workout\">\n<b>3 sets of:</b> <br>\n    Curl Up <b>10 - 20</b> <br>\n    Glute Bridge March <b>10 - 12</b><br>\n    Reach Backs <b>10 - 20</b><br>\n    Reverse Clams <b>10 - 20</b><br>\n    Standing Torso Rotations <b>5 - 10</b><br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"WFG-why\">\n<h4 class=\"center\"> What they are and why we do them</h4>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Curl Up</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-curlup pic right\"></div>\n<p>\nWhat it is: Get on your back and make one leg straight while the other is bent. Put your hands behind your back and elevate your elbows off the ground. Try to elevate your head and shoulders toward the ceiling and hold for one to two seconds. \n<p>Why we do them: to improve our core strength, which can greatly improve how fast we can swing the club head.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Glute Bridge March</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-glute pic right\"></div>\n<p>\nWhat it is: Lay on your back and get to the top of a glute-bridge position by pushing your weight into your heels and elevating your hips. Make sure your core is activated and then march in place, lifting one leg up and then switching sides. Hold your position at the top for one to two seconds each. \nWhy we do them:  to help drive more power from our legs when swinging, resulting in a stronger swing\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Reach Backs</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-reachback pic right\"></div>\n<p>\nWhat it is: Start by getting in an all-fours position on your hands and knees. Take one of your hands and place it on your head and then start rotating your upper body in the same direction. Try to isolate your upper body and don’t turn your lower body. \n<p>Why we do them: to improve our upper body strength, which is an integral part of swinging the club and playing golf</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Reverse Clams</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-reverse-clams pic right\"></div>\n<p>\nWhat it is: Lay on your side and have a cushion handy. Bring your legs forward and bend them at a 90-degree angle and place a cushion between your knees. Then start rotating your upper leg as far upwards as it can go while maintaining downward pressure with your knee on the cushion.\n<p>Why we do them: to improve your hip strength and flexibility which believe it or not can help with how “large” you swing can be and how strong your follow through will be.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Standing Torso Rotations</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-standing-torso pic right\"></div>\n<p>\nWhat it is: Start by setting up in a golf posture with your hands on your chest. While keeping your lower body stable, rotate your body as far as you can go in one direction and then repeat in the opposite direction. Try doing this exercise in front of a mirror to make sure your hips aren’t rotating.\n<p>Why we do them:  to strengthen the golf win in general as it is pretty much a weight lifting version of swinging the club.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
