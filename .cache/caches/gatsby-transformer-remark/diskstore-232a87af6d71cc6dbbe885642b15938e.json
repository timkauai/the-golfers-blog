I think that is something we would all want! \n<p>Here are 2 workouts you can do to improve your golf game:</p>\n<div> \n<h3> Workout #1 </h3>\n<div class=\"WFG-workout\">\n<b>3 sets of:</b> <br>\n    Curl Up <b>10 - 20</b> <br>\n    Glute Bridge March <b>10 - 12</b><br>\n    Reach Backs <b>10 - 20</b><br>\n    Reverse Clams <b>10 - 20</b><br>\n    Standing Torso Rotations <b>5 - 10</b><br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"WFG-why\">\n<h4 class=\"center\"> What they are and why we do them</h4>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Curl Up</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-curlup right\"></div>\n<p>\n  • What it is: Get on your back and make one leg straight while the other is bent. Put your hands behind your back and elevate your elbows off the ground. Try to elevate your head and shoulders toward the ceiling and hold for one to two seconds. \n<p>  • Why we do them: to improve our core strength, which can greatly improve how fast we can swing the club head.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Glute Bridge March</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-glute pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Lay on your back and get to the top of a glute-bridge position by pushing your weight into your heels and elevating your hips. Make sure your core is activated and then march in place, lifting one leg up and then switching sides. Hold your position at the top for one to two seconds each. \n<p> • Why we do them:  to help drive more power from our legs when swinging, resulting in a stronger swing</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Reach Backs</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-reachback pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Start by getting in an all-fours position on your hands and knees. Take one of your hands and place it on your head and then start rotating your upper body in the same direction. Try to isolate your upper body and don’t turn your lower body. \n<p> • Why we do them: to improve our upper body strength, which is an integral part of swinging the club and playing golf</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Reverse Clams</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-reverse-clams pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Lay on your side and have a cushion handy. Bring your legs forward and bend them at a 90-degree angle and place a cushion between your knees. Then start rotating your upper leg as far upwards as it can go while maintaining downward pressure with your knee on the cushion.\n<p> • Why we do them: to improve your hip strength and flexibility which believe it or not can help with how “large” you swing can be and how strong your follow through will be.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Standing Torso Rotations</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-standing-torso pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Start by setting up in a golf posture with your hands on your chest. While keeping your lower body stable, rotate your body as far as you can go in one direction and then repeat in the opposite direction. Try doing this exercise in front of a mirror to make sure your hips aren’t rotating.\n<p> • Why we do them:  to strengthen the golf win in general as it is pretty much a weight lifting version of swinging the club.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div> \n<h3> Workout #2 </h3>\n<div class=\"WFG-workout\">\n<b>3 sets of:</b> <br>\n    Seated Rotations <b>10 per side</b> <br>\n    Standing Y's <b>10 reps</b><br>\n    Handwalks <b>10 reps</b><br>\n    90/90 <b>10 per side</b><br>\n    Lateral Pillar Bridge <b>10 per side</b><br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"WFG-why\">\n<h4 class=\"center\"> What they are and why we do them</h4>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Seated Rotations</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-seated-rotations pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n  • What it is: Sit straddling a bench, or squeeze a pad or towel between your knees. Hold a club behind your back with your arms, so it sits in the crook of your elbows. Set your palms flat on your stomach and maintain your posture. Without moving your hips, rotate your torso to the right and hold for two seconds. Return to the starting position, then continue to the left and hold for two seconds. \n<p>  • Why we do them: These will improve your rotational mobility, a key component of the golf swing.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Standing Y's</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-standing-ys pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Stand bent over at the waist with your back flat and chest up, as if you were about to do a deadlift. Hold a golf club with a supinated grip (palms facing up). Pull your shoulder blades back and down and raise your arms over your head to form a Y. Return to the starting position. That’s one rep.\n<p> • Why we do them:  Improves shoulder mobility and also counteracts the negative impact of sitting.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Handwalks</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-handwalks pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Start by getting in an all-fours position on your hands and knees. Take one of your hands and place it on your head and then start rotating your upper body in the same direction. Try to isolate your upper body and don’t turn your lower body. \n<p> • Why we do them: to improve our upper body strength, which is an integral part of swinging the club and playing golf</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Reverse Clams</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-reverse-clams pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Start standing up. Bend forward at the waist and set your hands on the ground so you’re on all fours. Slowly walk your hands out into a pushup position. Then, making sure to keep your knees straight, walk your toes toward your hands\n<p> • Why we do them: To prevent “golfer’s elbow” and reduce the risk of shoulder injury.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>90/90 Stretch</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-90-90 pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is:  Lie on one side with the bottom leg straight and the top leg bent with the inside of the knee on the ground. Rotate your trunk back attempting to put the top shoulder blade on the ground.\n<p> • Why we do them: This move opens up your shoulders, helping to build flexibility and mobility.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\"> \n<b>Lateral Pillar Bridge</b>\n<div class=\"WFG-90-90 pic right\"></div>\n<p>\n • What it is: Lie on one side with your body in a straight line and your elbow under your shoulder, feet stacked. Push your hip off the ground, creating a straight line from ankle to shoulder. Hold this pose for three seconds. Be sure to keep your head in line with your spine—don’t sag or bend.\n<p> • Why we do them: This opens up the hips, preventing back pain.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}
